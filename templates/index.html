        <h2>Emp has launched!</h2>        
        <p> Welcome to the Emp website, we plan on updating you as the day progresses to 
        let you know how <a href="http://rit.edu/imagine">Imagine RIT</a> is going! But 
        please feel free to stop by if you are in the area. We will be explaining the uses 
        and taking ideas for possible plugins. We will be keeping a running list and tally 
        here: <a href="pluginlist.php">Plugin Tally</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Please look around our website to get more information, we will also be online
        during Imagine taking and answering questions on our freenode channel <em>#emp-dev</em> and
        <em>#emp-help</em>. You can join either channel and chat from our website on our 
        <a href="contact.php">Contact</a> page.
        </p>
    
        <p>While you are here, whether you are at Imagine or not, consider tweeting your
        ideas to <a href="http://twitter.com/emp_dev">@emp_dev</a> as well. We are looking
        for popular online or offline services that you use often that you would like a 
        monitoring system to supervise for you. For examples of some uses, check out our
        <a href="about.php">About page</a>.
